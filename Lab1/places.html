    <h1>Places in Cleveland </h1>
    <h3>
        Cleveland is the second largest city in Ohio and represents modernization with a rustic flare. The city has a strong cultural side, with theaters, museums, and a thriving social scene in the Flats East Bank, where the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie converge. In the 1800s, Cleveland was one of the most important canal ports in the eastern United States and an industrial center where some of the richest American entrepreneurs made their fortunes. The luxury residences on Euclid Avenue, known as Millionaires' Row, are a testament to their wealth.
        Among those who lived here around the turn of the 19th century 
        were John D. Rockefeller, founder of the Standard Oil Company,
        and Samuel Mather, who made his fortune in steel production and transport.
